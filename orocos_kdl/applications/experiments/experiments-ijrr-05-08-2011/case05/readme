Experimental setup, case5:

In this set of experiments, we work with 1-dof 1-link arm.
The following conventions for frames and rotations are used:

*Global frames and rotations
^ +Y
|
|
|
|--------> +X

+Z axis is pointing out of the page (right hand rule).
Positive rotations are in counter-clockwise directions.

*Local frames
External force wrenches and link distal frames have
their +Y axis always along the link length.
Check enclosed figure (frameConvention.pdf)


The following set of external and internal forces are present:

* gravitational force is present
* virtual constraint forces are present
* internal joint torque is NOT present
* external forces on a link are NOT present


Initial configuration:
q = pi/2.0 rads, qDot = 0.0 rad/sec, qDotDot = 0.0 rad/sec*sec


Summary:

In this setup, one would like to keep the link in state of equilibrium.
In this state all forces and moments are balanced. This can be achieved
in two ways:
* Gravitational force is balanced by an external force applied on the link
* active joint torques (in the context of the algorithm, these torques can be
calculated by introducing virtual EE constraints or by FD of the link).

In this setup the equilibrium is achieved by introducing virtual constraint forces
at EE, which are then used to calculate respective joint torques. To achieve
the equilibrium all of DOFs of the system should be constrained. In case of 1-dof
link, this DOF comes from the rotational component around Z-axis. Therefore, the constraint
force at EE should be  applied along this DOF. Additionally, for 1-dof link system
this equilibrium is equivalent to null space configuration of the system.
