Experimental setup, case3:

In this set of experiments, we work with 1-dof 1-link arm.
The following conventions for frames and rotations are used:

*Global frames and rotations
^ +Y
|
|
|
|--------> +X

+Z axis is pointing out of the page (right hand rule).
Positive rotations are in counter-clockwise directions.

*Local frames
External force wrenches and link distal frames have
their +Y axis always along the link length.
Check enclosed figure (frameConvention.pdf)


The following set of external and internal forces are present:

* the joint is moving at a constant rate
* internal joint torque is NOT present
* external forces on a link are NOT present
* virtual constraint forces are NOT present
* gravitational force is NOT present


Initial configuration:
q = pi/2.0 rads, qDot = 0.5 rad/sec, qDotDot = 0.0 rad/sec*sec

Summary:
In this setup a joint rotates with constant velocity. Therefore, neither joint space
nor Cartesian space acceleration are generated. The joint position changes (in this case increases)
linearly. Such motion is similar to that of a rigid body in a plance moving with a constant
velocity (Newton's first law is applicable in this case.).
