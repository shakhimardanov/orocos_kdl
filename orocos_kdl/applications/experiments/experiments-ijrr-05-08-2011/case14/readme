Experimental setup, case14

In this set of experiments, we work with 2-dof (in joint space) 2-link arm.
The following conventions for frames and rotations are used:

*Global frames and rotations
^ +Y
|
|
|
|--------> +X

+Z axis is pointing out of the page (right hand rule).
Positive rotations are in counter-clockwise directions.

*Local frames
External force wrenches and link distal frames have
their +Y axis always along the link length.
Check enclosed figure (frameConventions.pdf)


The following set of external and internal forces are present:
* gravitational force is present
* virtual constraint forces are present in X defined in global inertial frame (user level).
* internal joint torques are present
* external forces on a link are NOT present
* m1=m2=0.3kg, l1=l2=0.4m


Integrator type:
*Euler=AB1 and use h=0.001


Configuration 1:

-plot-no-constraint-PID-control.pdf
Initial configuration:
q0 = 0.0 rads, q1 = pi/6.0 rads,
qDot0 = 0.0 rad/sec, qDot1 = 0.0 rad/sec
qDotDot0 = 0.0 rad/sec*sec, qDotDot1 = 0.0 rad/sec*sec

Final configuration:
q0=pi/6.0, q1=pi/4.0

Control law and gains:
Kp=Kv=Ki=10
feedforwardJointTorque0 = jointAccelerations[1](0) + (Kp)*jointPoses[2](0) + (1.2*Kv)*jointRates[2](0) + (Ki)*jointPoses[3](0);
feedforwardJointTorque1 = jointAccelerations[1](1) + (1000*Kp)*jointPoses[2](1) + (4*Kv)*jointRates[2](1)+ (Ki)*jointPoses[3](0);



Configuration 2:

-plot-with-constraint-PID-control.pdf
Initial configuration:
q0 = 0.0 rads, q1 = pi/6.0 rads,
qDot0 = 0.0 rad/sec, qDot1 = 0.0 rad/sec
qDotDot0 = 0.0 rad/sec*sec, qDotDot1 = 0.0 rad/sec*sec

Final configuration:
q0=pi, q1=-pi/6.0

Control law and gains:
Kp=Kv=Ki=10
feedforwardJointTorque0 = jointAccelerations[1](0) + (Kp)*jointPoses[2](0) + (1.2*Kv)*jointRates[2](0) + (Ki)*jointPoses[3](0);
feedforwardJointTorque1 = jointAccelerations[1](1) + (1000*Kp)*jointPoses[2](1) + (4*Kv)*jointRates[2](1)+ (Ki)*jointPoses[3](0);
