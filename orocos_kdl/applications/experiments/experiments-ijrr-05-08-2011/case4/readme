Experimental setup, case4:

In this set of experiments, we work with 1-dof 1-link arm.
The following conventions for frames and rotations are used:

*Global frames and rotations
^ +Y
|
|
|
|--------> +X

+Z axis is pointing out of the page (right hand rule).
Positive rotations are in counter-clockwise directions.

*Local frames
External force wrenches and link distal frames have
their +Y axis always along the link length.
Check enclosed figure (frameConvention.pdf)


The following set of external and internal forces are present:

* internal joint torque is present and constant
* gravitational force is present
* external forces on a link are NOT present
* virtual constraint forces are NOT present


Initial configuration:
q = pi/2.0 rads, qDot = 0.0 rad/sec, qDotDot = 0.0 rad/sec*sec
qTorque = +20 Nm

Summary:

In this setup in addition to gravitational force on the point mass, a joint
applies a constant torque on the link. If there were not for joint torque, then
the link would oscillate eternally under the affect of the gravity, as it happens
in case1. But applied joint torque, depending on its magnitude, adds
exciting motion. Such motion is similar to that
of the spring-mass system with negative damping factor, 
where amplitude and frequency increase with time (?!).

Depending on in which quadrant the link is (either IV (+X,-Y) or III (-X,-Y))
the torque works either with the gravity (quad. III) or against it (quad. IV).
Therefore, the effects of the applied constant torque are neutralized (negligible).
But as soon as the magnitude of the torque becomes bigger than that of total gravitational
force, the motion becomes excited and continues with growing amplitude and oscillation frequency.
This can be well observed from enclosed plots. All physical quantities both in
joint and Cartesian space will increase gradually.
