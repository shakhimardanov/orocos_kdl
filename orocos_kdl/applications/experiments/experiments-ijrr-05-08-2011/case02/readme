Experimental setup, case2:

In this set of experiments, we work with 1-dof 1-link arm.
The following conventions for frames and rotations are used:

*Global frames and rotations
^ +Y
|
|
|
|--------> +X

+Z axis is pointing out of the page (right hand rule).
Positive rotations are in counter-clockwise directions.

*Local frames
External force wrenches and link distal frames have
their +Y axis always along the link length.
Check enclosed figure (frameConvention.pdf)


The following set of external and internal forces are present:

* internal joint torque is present and has constant value
* external forces on a link are NOT present
* virtual constraint forces are NOT present
* gravitational force is NOT present

Initial configuration:
q = pi/2.0 rads, qDot = 0.0 rad/sec, qDotDot = 0.0 rad/sec*sec
qTorque = +1 Nm
Summary:

Under these conditions the motion of the link is similar to that of a rigid body on the plane
under the affect of constant linear force. In the later case the object will accelerate with constant
acceleration, while its velocity will increase linearly (Newton's second law).
In case of the link, this motion will have rotational character and will follow Euler's equation of motion,
where the torque applied on the link is constant. This constant torque generates constant angular acceleration.
This acceleration causes a linear increase in joint rate and a parabolic increase in joint position.
These effects can be observed in enclosed plots. At the same time constant torque
cause EE to accelerate. EE Cartesian space acceleration are related to joint space counterparts
through the Jacobian transpose. Therefore, as it was in "case1" , Z component
of EE acceleration is equal in magnitude and direction to that of qDotDot, while
Y component becomes zero. This happens because of the fact that there are no
any forces (neither external nor reaction) in this direction.
