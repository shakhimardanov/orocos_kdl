Experimental setup, case11

In this set of experiments, we work with 2-dof (in joint space) 2-link arm.
The following conventions for frames and rotations are used:

*Global frames and rotations
^ +Y
|
|
|
|--------> +X

+Z axis is pointing out of the page (right hand rule).
Positive rotations are in counter-clockwise directions.

*Local frames
External force wrenches and link distal frames have
their +Y axis always along the link length.
Check enclosed figure (frameConventions.pdf)


The following set of external and internal forces are present:
* gravitational force is present
* virtual constraint forces are present in X defined in global inertial frame (user level).
* internal joint torques are NOT present
* external forces on a link are NOT present
* m1=m2=0.3kg, l1=l2=0.4m


Initial configuration:
q0 = pi/2.0 rads, q1 = 0.0 rads,
qDot0 = 0.0 rad/sec, qDot1 = 0.0 rad/sec
qDotDot0 = 0.0 rad/sec*sec, qDotDot1 = 0.0 rad/sec*sec
