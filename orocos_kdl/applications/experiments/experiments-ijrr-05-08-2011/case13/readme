Experimental setup, case13

In this set of experiments, we work with 2-dof (in joint space) 2-link arm.
The following conventions for frames and rotations are used:

*Global frames and rotations
^ +Y
|
|
|
|--------> +X

+Z axis is pointing out of the page (right hand rule).
Positive rotations are in counter-clockwise directions.

*Local frames
External force wrenches and link distal frames have
their +Y axis always along the link length.
Check enclosed figure (frameConventions.pdf)


The following set of external and internal forces are present:
* gravitational force is present
* virtual constraint forces are present in X defined in global inertial frame (user level).
* internal joint torques are NOT present
* external forces on a link are NOT present
* m1=m2=0.3kg, l1=l2=0.4m


Integrator type:
*Euler=AB1 and use h=0.001


Compensator:
On cartesian errors. This is done through betha set point.

Initial configuration:
q0 = 0.0 rads, q1 = pi/6.0 rads,
qDot0 = 0.0 rad/sec, qDot1 = 0.0 rad/sec
qDotDot0 = 0.0 rad/sec*sec, qDotDot1 = 0.0 rad/sec*sec
Kp = 150, Kv = 10, Ki= 10

//betha(0) = alpha(0, 0)*((Kp / 2000.0) * cartXDotDot[2][1].vel[0] + (Kv / 400.0) * cartXDot[2][1].vel[0] + (Kp) * cartX[2][1].p[0]); // 0.5xgain
//betha(1) = alpha(1, 1)*((Kp / 1000.0) * cartXDotDot[2][1].vel[1] + (Kv / 250.0) * cartXDot[2][1].vel[1] + (1.5 * Kp) * cartX[2][1].p[1] + Ki * cartX[3][1].p[0]);
