Experimental setup, case7:

In this set of experiments, we work with 2-dof (in joint space) 2-link arm.
The following conventions for frames and rotations are used:

*Global frames and rotations
^ +Y
|
|
|
|--------> +X

+Z axis is pointing out of the page (right hand rule).
Positive rotations are in counter-clockwise directions.

*Local frames
External force wrenches and link distal frames have
their +Y axis always along the link length.
Check enclosed figure (frameConventions.pdf)


The following set of external and internal forces are present:
* gravitational force is present and is in -Y
* internal joint torques are NOT present
* external forces on a link are NOT present
* virtual constraint forces are NOT present


Initial configuration:
q0 = pi/2.0 rads, q1 = 0.0 rads,
qDot0 = 0.0 rad/sec, qDot1 = 0.0 rad/sec
qDotDot0 = 0.0 rad/sec*sec, qDotDot1 = 0.0 rad/sec*sec

Summary:
The motion generated in this case could be viewed as two
harmonic motions superimposed on each other( or is it a chaotic motion ?!).
This system configuration is also referred to as double compound pendulum

Since there are no any non-conservative forces affecting the system, it will
oscillate eternally. The interesting aspect is that in its initial configuration
EE Cartesian pose in X has highest value, but later on it decreases.
The reason is that, most of the total potential energy of the system is converted
into kinetic energy of the second link. Therefore, one can observe higher values for
joint1 pose(q), rate(qDot1) and acceleration(qDotDot1).
