Experimental setup, case6:

In this set of experiments, we work with 1-dof 1-link arm.
The following conventions for frames and rotations are used:

*Global frames and rotations
^ +Y
|
|
|
|--------> +X

+Z axis is pointing out of the page (right hand rule).
Positive rotations are in counter-clockwise directions.

*Local frames
External force wrenches and link distal frames have
their +Y axis always along the link length.
Check enclosed figure (frameConvention.pdf)


The following set of external and internal forces are present:

* gravitational force is present
* external forces on a link are present
* virtual constraint forces are NOT present
* internal joint torque is NOT present



Initial configuration:
q = pi/2.0 rads, qDot = 0.0 rad/sec, qDotDot = 0.0 rad/sec*sec


Summary:
This setup will generate motion similar to that in case4, where constant
joint torque and gravity were present. Depending on the magnitude
of the external force, its effects
* could be negligible
* could lead to equilibrium
* could excite the system and increase its amplitude and frequency.

The external force is applied at the center of geometry (in the middle)
of the link. Therefore, to achieve equilibrium its magnitude should be
twice as big as of the gravitational force at the point mass (equivalently
the moment it generates should be twice as much).
If the magnitude of the external force satisfied |Fext| > 2*|Weight_object|
than the motion will have excited character and will continue with growing
amplitude and frequency.
