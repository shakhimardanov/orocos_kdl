Experimental setup, case1:

In this set of experiments, we work with 1-dof 1-link arm.
The following conventions for frames and rotations are used:

*Global frames and rotations
^ +Y
|
|
|
|--------> +X

+Z axis is pointing out of the page (right hand rule).
Positive rotations are in counter-clockwise directions.

*Local frames
External force wrenches and link distal frames have
their +Y axis always along the link length.
Check enclosed figure (frameConventions.pdf)


The following set of external and internal forces are present:
* gravitational force is present and is in -Y
* internal joint torques are NOT present
* external forces on a link are NOT present
* virtual constraint forces are NOT present


Initial configuration:
q = pi/2.0 rads, qDot = 0.0 rad/sec, qDotDot = 0.0 rad/sec*sec

Summary:

Under these conditions the motion of the link, which is pivoted at one end
looks like to that of a simple pendulum. That is, it undergoes a harmonic motion
with constant period of oscillations. But unlike the case of simple pendulum the force
distribution is different. The forces do not only affect the end point mass, but
also generate reaction forces at the pivot. That is, total gravitational force generated
at the point mass is distributed between the reaction forces at the pivot and rest forces
on the point mass. The moment generated by the rest forces causes the joint to accelerate
with qDotDot (in one of the enclosed plots). This joint acceleration is equal to Z component
acceleration of EE in Cartesian space. At the same time EE Cartesian space acceleration
is related with joint space qDotDot through a Jacobian Transpose.

Since there is no any damping (e.g. friction forces) present, the amplitude of the oscillations
never exceeds q = pi/2.0, and the motion takes place in lower quadrants of [Y,X] plane.
